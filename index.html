                    I graduated from the <em>University of Illinois Urbana Champaign</em> in May 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science in <strong>Electrical Engineering</strong>. 
                    My first job was as a contractor for company called <em>Rauland</em>, performing work as a <strong>Parts Engineer</strong>.  When my contract ended, I started 
                    as a full time employee at <em>Yaskawa America Inc.</em>, working in the Drive's division as a <strong>Technical Support Engineer</strong>, where I worked for 4 years. <br><br>
                    While these were both fine opportunities for employment, I ultimately decided to pursue a career in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> as the work and lifestyle better suit me. <br><br>
                    I'm looking forward to working hard for you and bringing much value to your establishment!

                        Whenever someone asks me what my favorite video game is, I usually never say
                        "<b>DDR</b>", but that's because it's <b>SO</b> much more to me than just a game.  Not only is
                        it amazing and <i>fun</i> cardio, but the competitive aspect of the game has produced
                        many of my best friendships and going to tournaments is like a family reunion. <br>
                        I'm so glad that I decided to start playing close to 20 years ago, continued to keep
                        after my local scene died out, and joined the national scene 10 years ago; I couldn't 
                        imagine my life without this game and the wonderful people I've met along the way.
                        I used to be one of the best players in the world and I'm slowly coming out of retirement; I hope
                        to be a top level player again one day.<br>
                        <br>
                        Beyond DDR, at the beginning of this year I decided to start pursuing a dream of mine that I've 
                        had for a while now: comedy.  It started with taking improv classes at <b><i>The Annoyance</i></b>
                        in Chicago, but I also started taking an acting class as well.  While pursuing those dreams of 
                        stardom have been put on hold for this bootcamp, I am in anticipation of when I can start again; 
                        I desire to be on the big screen one day and I would at the very least like to move closer to the city.

                <h3>My journey to coding</h3>
                <p>I've taken quite a few coding classes in Java, C, 
                    C++, SystemVerilog and some pseudo assembly code.  
                    While Python, JavaScript and TypeScript will all 
                    be new to me and I'm not the best coder I'm super 
                    excited to become a monster</p>

<!-- Semantic vs non-semantic elements

Non-semantic: older that still work (late 90s to early 2000s), but we have better options (sometimes)
Semantic: the tag carries meaning in what the content is (best practices)

Non-semantic:
div - most basic BLOCK level element
span - most basic INLINE element 
img - images
a - anchor tags or links
form - how we send info to databases/back-end
label - for an input to say what it is
input - taking in user input
button - things to click to make things happen
h1 - h6 - headings
p - paragraphs
ul, ol - lists
li - list items
tables - aren't super useful anymore but we still use them

Semantic:
header - indicates the top of the page/section
main - primary content on the page
aside - less important content on the page
footer - bottom of the page/section (usually contact info)
section - a block of content within our main tag
articles - standalone content
nav - for groups of links/navigation elements

==> these are all just divs with different names
